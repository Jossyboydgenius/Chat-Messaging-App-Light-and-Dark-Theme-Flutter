# Chat/Messaging App Light and Dark Theme - Flutter UI

**Packages we are using:**

- goole_fonts: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)

We're building a messaging/chat app using #Flutter that runs on both Android and iOS devices, with support for both dark and light themes. We'll create a total of 4 screens, all of which support both themes.

First, we'll design a welcome screen that contains an image with a tagline and a skip button. Once the user presses it, they'll be transferred to the Sign-in or Sign-up screen.

The last two screens are the main screens: the Chats screen, which shows the list of people you've chatted with, and the Message screen, which supports text messages, audio messages, and video messages.

**Complete UI Contains:**

► Splash Screen
► Welcome Screen
► Sign in & Sign up
► Phone Validation (OTP)
► Forget Password
► Change Password
► Chats Screen
► Search Chats
► Message Screen
► Audio Call
► Video Call
► Contacts
► Search Contacts
► Call History
► Search on Call history
► Profile Screen
► Edit Profile
